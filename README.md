This data analysis project will analyse top Spotify song data by audio attributes, year, and artists from 2008 through 2020. The complicated relationship between audio features and song popularity will be analysed, thus we further dug down by year, artist, and audio feature. Popular songs and non-popular songs do have certain critical differences, such as the duration of the song, its acoustic and loudness, etc

Based on a user's listening preferences, Spotify uses data to generate playlists that are tailored to their tastes. Is it possible to identify correlations between a song's popularity and the other quantifiable aspects, given how songs have been quantified by Spotify.

The following questions will help us to analyse Spotifyâ€™s stream-popularity metric in greater context of the data:

1.	Based on characteristics of the music itself, such as danceability, energy, and acousticness etc, what can we infer about a song's popularity?
2.	 How do each of these factors influence our ability to predict the popularity of an artist or song?
